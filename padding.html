    <p style=" margin-left: 170px;" draggable="true"> Information technology (IT) is a set of related fields that
        encompass computer systems,
        software, programming
        languages and data and information processing and storage.[1] IT forms part of information and communications
        technology (ICT).[2] An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a
        communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and
        peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users, and an IT project usually refers to the
        commissioning and implementation of an IT system.[3]
